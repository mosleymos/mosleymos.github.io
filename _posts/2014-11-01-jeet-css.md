### JEET a css framework for humans

Recently I've discovered JEET a css framework very simple.

Although I use bootstrap in order to organize my html, the code it's
quite "noisy" and "dirty"

I mean for instance in order to simply use 1 row divide in two equals parts 
I need to write this code

{% highlight html %}

<div class='row'>
    <div class='col-md-6'>
    </div>

    <div class='col-md-6'>
    </div>
</div>

{% endhighlight html %}

It's quite long and when I've got to look after I've got dozen and dozen 
of rows It's quite an hassle to read.


Then I've discovered JEET which got a simpler syntax than above.

{% highlight ruby %}
column
{% endhighlight ruby %}

I think I'll change progressively to this framework.

Their slogan "A grid system for humans" sounds great.
Here the link to the project [JEET](http://jeet.gs).
