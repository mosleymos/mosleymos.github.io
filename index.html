        <h3>Hello World</h3>
        <p>It's my first post, and frankly I don't know what's to begin with. 
        Maybe because this blog has been decided to be created on a whim.</p>
        <p>
        I'd wanted to try github personnal page service so here we are.

        <h3>JEET a css framework for human (or I think so)</h3>
        <p>
        Recently I've discovered JEET a css framework very simple.
        Although I use bootstrap in order to organize my html, the code it's
        quite "noisy" and "dirty"
        </p>
        <p>
        I mean for instance in order to simply use 1 row divide in two equals parts 
        I need to write this code
          <code>
              <div class="container">
                  <div class="row">
                      <div class="col-md-12">
                          My text
                     </div>
                 </div>
             </div>
          </code>
        It's quite long and when I've got to look after I've got dozen and dozen 
        of rows It's quite an hassle to read.
        </p>
        <p>
        Then I've discovered JEET which got a simpler syntax than above.
        <code>
            column
        </code>
        </p>
        <p>I think I'll change progressively to this framework.</p>
        <p>Their slogan "A grid system for humans" sounds great</p>

        <h3>Long Code </h3>
        <p>Recently I make some katas in ruby, javascript and python with the site <a href="http://www.codewars.com">Codewars</a></p>
        <p>I try during these exercices to solve the problem with one line of code.</p>
        <p>The fizzbuzz problem end with this type of code</p>
        <code>
            
        <code>
        <p>Quite funny! and recently I've found this.</p>
        <code>
        
        </code>
        <p>Not usable in my state of knowledge but I'll continue to learn.
