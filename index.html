            <h3>Hello World</h3>
                <p>It's my first post, and frankly I don't know what's to begin with. 
                Maybe because this blog has been decided to be created on a whim.</p>
                <p>
                I'd wanted to try github personnal page service so here we are.

            <h3>JEET a css framework for human (or I think so)</h3>
                <p>
                Recently I've discovered JEET a css framework very simple.
                Although I use bootstrap in order to organize my html, the code it's
                quite "noisy" and "dirty"
                </p>
                <p>
                I mean for instance in order to simply use 1 row divide in two equals parts 
                I need to write this code
                  <code>
                                  My text
                  </code>
                It's quite long and when I've got to look after I've got dozen and dozen 
                of rows It's quite an hassle to read.
                </p>
                <p>
                Then I've discovered JEET which got a simpler syntax than above.
                <code>
                    column
                </code>
                </p>
                <p>I think I'll change progressively to this framework.</p>
                <p>Their slogan "A grid system for humans" sounds great</p>

            <h3>Long Code </h3>
                <p>Recently I make some katas in ruby, javascript and python with the site <a href="http://www.codewars.com">Codewars</a></p>
                <p>I try during these exercices to solve the problem with one line of code.</p>
                <p>The fizzbuzz problem end with this type of code</p>
                <code>
                    
                <code>
                <p>Quite funny! and recently I've found this.</p>
                <code>
                
                </code>
                <p>Not usable in my state of knowledge but I'll continue to learn.</p>
